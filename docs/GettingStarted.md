## Getting started

Your kit should include [this inventory](#inventory) You should have had time to play with your foldscope and get used to capturing images on your phone. Here's a fast and dirty assembly if you're in a rush to get going. Practice capturing images before you make your first moulds though!

We've included a random pre-prepared slide donated from a microscope enthusiast from the Wirral in Merseyside.

### Quick Foldscope Assembly 🔬

We are going to do a quick build of a
[Foldscope](https://www.foldscope.com/) Prakesh Labs ingenious bit of
microengineering for frugal science.

1.  Open up your foldscope kit and open the instructions. We are going
    to just build the lens stage and focus ramp, a minimal build to look
    at some algae and make moulds and connect to our phone cameras.
    Steps 1 - 6, and step 10. of the **ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS**
    1.  Insert coupler into Lens stage
    2.  Insert another coupler into the reverse of the stage
    3.  Fold and lock the bottom flap
    4.  Insert lens into the Lens stage.
    5.  Fold the Focus ramp
    6.  Insert ramp into stage
    7.  Fold the bottom of the Lens stage.


### Slide prep 🐛

Inject equal amounts (0.5ml) of silicon from syringe A and fixer from syringe B into the 'floor' your mini petri dish (it's the smaller diameter part)

Mix well and add lid

Carefully spin with your DIY paperfuge!

Another tricky bit! Use the micro disposable pipette to inject a drop of algae suspenstion into the side of the impressed silicon. Capilliary action should pull the liquid into the tiny impressions of the chip surface markings or the vinyl channels

Insert your prepared slide here (be careful slotting it in not to push your coverslip away)


That's it, setup your phone below and see if your algae companions can navigate your microfluidic landscape

### Connect to phone. 🤳 📷

Refer to **Phone View** in **VIEWING** section overleaf.

1.  Take the round white double sided peel off sticker and stick it
    carefully over your phone camera lens, make sure you dont get the
    glue on the lens. It comes off with water if you do 😀

2.  Remove the white cover. Now theres a sticky side facing up.

3.  Take the other coupler and place it silver side down over the lens.
    Keep the lens central to the couplers hole.

### Inventory 

<img src="bookletimages/1.png" height="200">

Prepared & labelled syringes filled with PDMS (A) & hardener (B). PDMS is a non-volatile silicon and safe to handle, but not ingest. We advise taking care to wash your hands thoroughly after use and store them in the already open plastic sleeves. Unmixed they store for up to a year. Be careful not to cross contaminate the A & B components or they will harden in storage.

555 Timer chip. Common chip in maker projects. See https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/WearableTechBadgeWorkshop/blob/master/555Tutorials.md for what you can make with timers. 

<img src="bookletimages/2.png" height="200">

Micro-petri-dish with lid. Mix PDMS together and make impressions with chip surfaces. You could use anything you think might make tiny  impressions in the surface of your PDMS mould.

Random pre-prepared slide

Vinyl record Fragment. Some of you may not have a record collection and listen on big data infrastuctures like Spotify or YouTube or maybe if you care about artists getting paid, Bandcamp. You can't really get impressions from these sources although if you could access their server racks in the correct data centre you could find a hard drive that likely has some micro-engineered structures but you'd get in trouble!
